== Calendar Annotator

A tool to create private notes for Google Calendar events.

=== Getting it up and running

This is designed to run on Heroku but should be easy enough to get up and running
anywhere else.

* It is tested with Ruby 2.0.0
* Various Environment variables are required as documented in config/secrets.yml
* It runs against postgres but doesn't depend on its features

=== To Do

* Scope notes to instances of recurring events
* Use it for a while and see how it works out
